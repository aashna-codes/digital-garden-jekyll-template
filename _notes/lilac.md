title: lilac

i once held a bouquet of lavender  
lilac and light all at once 
i felt the wind sweep the rest of me aside  
and capture a moment while it was young  
<br\>
i held on to this moment a moment too long  
until it begged to be let go  
it was then that i realised i decide  
what i will bring with me to my tomorrow
