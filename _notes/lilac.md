title: lilac

i once held a bouquet of lavender  
lilac and light all at once  
i felt the wind sweep the rest of me aside  
and capture a moment young  

i held on to this moment a moment too long  
until it begged to be let go  
it was then that i realised i decide  
what i bring with me to my tomorrow
