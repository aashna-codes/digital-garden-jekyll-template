by mirza ghalib  

हज़ारों ख़्वाहिशें ऐसी,  
के हर ख़्वाहिश पे दम निकले  
बहुत निकले मेरे अरमान,  
लेकिन फिर भी कम निकले  

[rough translation* :  
i have a thousand wishes,  
each is worth a lifetime;  
so many have been fullfilled  
and yet not nearly enough have been fulfilled.]  

* as my dad says, urdu often doesn't translate well into english  
and some day i will regret not learning it
