title: melody

when sunlight pours herself through my window glass  
i hear poetry the way it was meant to be heard 
i notice i don't mind if the voice speaks too fast 
i don't mind if it speaks too slow too narrow or too vast  
<br/>
and even if the fragility of interpretability is lost 
or the inevitability of comprehensibility is found  
i hear poetry the way it was meant to be heard  
i hear it in the melody of your sound
