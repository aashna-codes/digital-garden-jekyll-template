title: you
---

you are an expression of joy  
the movement of breath on a still day  
yesterday's yellow lights slipping away  
drifting deep with so much left to say  
you are the dance of a heart full of love  
the rhythm when the melody is strong  
bound by a moment we knew nothing of  
you are the sound of us all singing along  
you are hope and you are light  
a dream i dream in colour tonight  
 
with my eyes closed i see you  
you see  
you are home when one longs for nothing more
