title: begin
---

i walked a hundred miles  
wondering whether walking is worthwile  
i swam against the current  
leaving behind moments that weren't  

i stumbled and slipped  
and fumbled and flipped  
and stuttered and tripped  
and cluttered and skipped  

and yet to reach all the places i've been  
all it took was the courage to begin
